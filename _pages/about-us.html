<h2>Content Machines is a site designed to help you to create the content you need to market and sell your services.</h2>
<p>You need to make it easy for people to find you and your products and services on the internet. Companies that use relevant, targeted and persuasive content are ranked higher in search engines. When you market to companies, having well written emails can help you create a pipeline of prospects that are more likely to engage with you instead of dismissing your emails as spam.</p>
<h3>Your sales process needs well written content.</h3>
<p>When people find you and get in touch, having well written brochures that explain your services, clear case studies and a good selection of white papers can build your credibility and reassure your customers of your professionalism and track record.</p>
<p>You can keep in touch with your customers by sending them relevant and useful newsletter updates about news that will affect their business and opportunities theyÂ have to make or save money. Customers that get useful market intelligence from you on a regular basis are more likely to think of you first when they have a problem and contact you and ask how you can help them.</p>
<h3>Your content needs to be refreshed and updated regularly</h3>
<p>You also need to refresh your content regularly. Industries, technologies and approaches change all the time, and your customers need to see that you are well prepared and will continue to give them excellent service. Carrying out regular content audits and updating your content regularly will show them that you care about what you are selling.</p>
<h3>Aim to create content that helps your customer understand what you do</h3>
<p>Most companies are simply too busy to spend the time creating the content they need. Email templates, brochures, case studies, white papers and newsletters take time to research, draft, finalise and distribute. You might also be too close to your own services to always see them through the eyes of a customer.</p>
<p>It is crucial to take your products and services and express their benefits in language that is clear and simple to a customer. This site will help you see yourself through the eyes of your customer and create content that will help you sell more of your products and services and grow your business.</p>
