<h2>We help you create technical and commercial sales material</h2>
<p>We write a range of content from proposals, presentations and briefing notes to webpages, blog posts and publication ready articles. The work we do is primarily commercial and technical and aimed at a business reader. We make it easier for you to research, draft, edit and publish content that helps your customers and grows your business.</p>
<p>We help you develop marketing content for each stage of the sales funnel. Good content will help you attract customers, interest them, spark their desire for your services and motivate them to take action.</p>
<p>The reader is usually reading the content we create because it has to do with their job. They are often bored by the kind of material they get and we try to make it easy for them to scan and understand your content.</p>
<h2>We edit existing content to make it more reader friendly and visually appealing</h2>
<p>Your customers and prospects often ask for content to understand an issue or your product better. In this situation, is it best for this content to be created by your own subject matter expert?</p>
<p>Content that customers like usually does one of three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps them understand an issue</li>
<li>It helps them solve a problem</li>
<li>It helps them make a decision</li>
</ul>
<p>A subject matter expert could try and write a first draft that tries to meet the needs of a customer. The resulting draft, in our experience, is often technical and not easy to read. Unless your subject matter expert is also an experienced commercial writer the content is often written to explain what is in their mind rather than to have a reader understand what they write.</p>
<p>We can help by making your content reader friendly. We use headings to make your ideas clear, edit content so it can be scanned easily, select useful images, introduce relevant analysis and create a document that looks professional and well designed.</p>
<h2>We create new content that helps you make sales</h2>
<p>We help you clearly get your value proposition across to new customers. We create content that you can use across a number of platforms including blogs, industry journals, news outlets and specialist journals to make customers aware of what you do.</p>
<p>We can help you write direct response marketing content for direct mail and email sales and promotions.</p>
<p>We create sales scripts for in-person meetings and telephone prospecting that you can use to train salespeople to communicate clearly and effectively. Your sales teams will find it very helpful to have a selection of scripts to build on when talking to customers. If you have your own script book, it will make it easier to train new salespeople and shorten the time it takes to take customers through your sales funnel and sales pipeline process.</p>
<p>We write and edit website content that communicates what you do clearly to prospective customers.</p>
<p>We create marketing brochures, briefing notes, reports and white papers that you can use to differentiate yourself from others in your market and remove the objections your prospects have about working with you.</p>
<p>We create detailed case studies, technical content and business proposals that you can use to bid for work and persuade your prospects to take action.</p>
<h2>We advise on how you can create and execute a Content Strategy</h2>
<p>All business use content to market themselves, and good content is crucial to a good sales process.</p>
<p>We can help you develop your marketing strategy, segment your markets and develop online and offline content plans that communicate your brand and value proposition to your target customer.</p>
<p>We can help you deliver your content strategy, setting up the technical platforms to host your content and reach your customers and providing a regular content to meet your schedule.</p>
<h2>Our aim is to help you grow your business</h2>
<p>As a team of commercial writers, we aim to write good, fact based content that you can use to promote your services and grow your business. An effective content creation capability is as crucial to businesses in the 21<sup>st</sup> century as having electricity and computers in your office.</p>
