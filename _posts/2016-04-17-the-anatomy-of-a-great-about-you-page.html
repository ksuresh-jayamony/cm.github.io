<p>McGraw Hill used a great ad – the Man in the Chair ad – in the 1950s that showed a grumpy looking man sitting in a chair. Next to the image are a number of sentences, the gist of which is that he doesn't know what you do, who you are, who you have worked for. The final sentence asks what it is you want to sell him.</p>
<p>The essence of this story is that you need to build up to the sale by educating the prospect about you, your business and your credentials.</p>
<p>Your About You page will help with this if it answers the main questions someone asks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are you?</li>
<li>What do you do?</li>
<li>Where are you based?</li>
<li>Why do they need you?</li>
<li>When can they get in touch?</li>
<li>How can you help them?</li>
</ol>
