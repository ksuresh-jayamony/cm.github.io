<h2><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-76" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Rise-in-the-amount-of-content-on-the-internet-1.png" alt="Sketch showing increase in the amount of content on the internet" width="1572" height="1214" />You need to get your point across in less than 10 seconds</h2>
<p>The amount of material on the internet is growing every second.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to read and remember everything. In 2008, a <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/attention-span-statistics/"><u>study of web use</u></a> showed that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>17%</strong> of page views lasted less than 17 seconds</li>
<li><strong>4%</strong> of page views lasted more than 10 minutes</li>
<li><strong>28% </strong>of words were read on an average web page (593 words)</li>
</ul>
<p>Readers ruthlessly discard pages that do not interest them.</p>
<p>But, if they find something that interests them, they hang around.</p>
<p>The magic number is <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/"><u>10 seconds</u></a>.</p>
<p>If they stay this long, then they will look around some more.</p>
<p>And if you can interest them for 30 seconds, then they could look around for ages, or at least 2 minutes, which is the same thing on the web.</p>
<h2>But, you need to have good content to get readers in the first place</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-77" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Length-of-the-ideal-post-1.png" alt="Sketched histogram showing the number of words on webpages" width="1575" height="812" /></p>
<p>Search engines appear to think that if you have less than <a href="http://www.copypress.com/blog/4-statistics-every-blogger-should-know-about-content-word-count/"><u><span style="color: #0066cc;">200 words </span></u></a>on your web page, it's not worth reading.</p>
<p>An image heavy site is going to suffer if there isn't enough text in the page for the search engine to read.</p>
<p>Each image should have a <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2240729/why-thin-content-is-hurting-your-ecommerce-site-how-to-fix-it">description of its content</a>. This also increases the accessibility of the page.</p>
<p>So what is a good length for content on a page?</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/">Data from serpIQ </a>shows that top ranking pages have 2,000 to 2,500 words and they suggest that 1,500 words could be a good target.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So its crucial that you can create good long form content that helps search engines rank your pages and put them in front of prospects.</p>
<h2>Break up your content so it can be scanned quickly</h2>
<p>Many readers decide if a page is worth reading by looking at the headline, scanning the sub heads and getting a feel for the docment.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/">Neilsen</a>, pages should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concise</li>
<li>Scannable</li>
<li>Objective</li>
</ul>
<p>Your sentences should be short and to the point.</p>
<p>Use headlines and bullet points to break up the flow.</p>
<p>And let the facts speak for themselves.</p>
