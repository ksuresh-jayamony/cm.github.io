<p>Is there any research showing whether working with a partner to create content for your business is a good idea or not?</p>
<p><a href="http://skilledup-guides.s3.amazonaws.com/Content_Marketing_Marketers_New_Number_1_Engagement_Tool.pdf">Skilled-up</a> commissioned a survey of 200 professionals that found that a third of them found it difficult to find individuals with the right expertise.</p>
<p>This ranked third in a list of challenges they faced doing content marketing.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="231"]<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/042816_1218_Shouldyouou1.png" alt="Bar chart of top three challenges faced by content marketers: budget, time and expertise" width="231" height="153" /> The top three challenges faced by content marketers[/caption]</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237909">Entrepreneur</a> looked at the costs of hiring an internal creative team and the costs of an in-house writer, designer and web developer can quickly go over $100k.</p>
<p>If your company make a gross profit of $20 on every $100 of sales, this means you need to bring in an extra $500k of sales to cover the costs of the team.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.exacttarget.com/blog/4-reasons-to-stop-outsourcing-content-marketing-efforts-in-2014-v2/">alternative view</a> says that firms are bringing content creation back in-house as it becomes increasingly core to their revenue generation strategy.</p>
<p>Google's algorithms value quality over quantity, and outsourcing to a cheap provider that creates low quality content can make your results worse, not better.</p>
<p>Hiring professionals and training them may be better in the long run.</p>
<p>But is your only choice between internal and external content creation?</p>
<p>Just over <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/11/dos-donts-outsourcing-content-creation/">half of all companies</a> keep their content creation in house.</p>
<p>Very few use only outsourcing but the rest have a mix of internal and external content.</p>
<p>Interestingly, large companies are more likely (61%) to use a mixed approach rather than just using in-house content.</p>
<p>The need for content is going to increase and <a href="http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/outsource-content-marketing/">three quarters of small businesses</a> are using content marketing.</p>
<p>Keep some of <a href="http://marketeer.kapost.com/content-marketing-statistics/">these stats</a> in mind when thinking about how to design your content machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1 in every $3 is going to be spent on content marketing</li>
<li>15 blog posts a month generate 1,200 new leads on average</li>
<li>Less than half of B2B marketers have a written content strategy</li>
<li>85% of transactions will be carried out without talking to a human by 2020</li>
</ul>
